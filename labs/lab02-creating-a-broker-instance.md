# Lab 2. Creating a Broker Instance

The `artemis` script located in the `bin` folder is the starting point to manage our AMQ installation.

## Use the script to create a new broker instance

1. Execute the following command to create a new broker in the instances folder.

   ```sh
   $ <AMQ_HOME>/bin/artemis create <AMQ_HOME>/instances/mybroker
   ```

1. The command will ask a series of questions in order to configure the broker instance:

   * Use `admin` as username and password for the mandatory user
   * Add the `admin` role to the admin user
   * Allow anonymous access by typing `Y` when asked

   > As the AMQ Broker requires to persist messages, we need to have enough free space in the disk to store the messages, please chekc that there is at least 10% available.

## Directory Structure

```sh
$ cd instances/mybroker
$ tree
|-- bin
|-- data
|-- etc
|-- log
`-- tmp
```

| Folder | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| bin    | AMQ instance command line scripts to launch and manage |
| etc    | Broker instance configuration files |
| lib    | Extra libraries                                        |
| log    | Instance log files |
| data   | Journal files storage for persistent messages          |
| tmp | Temporary files |

End of Lab 2.
